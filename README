This is my resume site.
Still very much a work in progress.

So far i have:
 gotten a basic template started using bootstrap
 set up header and footer PHP pages to use as master pages
 set up a 404 and a 403 redirect
 used PHP to dynamically set the current page's title
 used PHP to dynamically highlight the current page's nav bar tab
 gotten place holders into each page.
