This is my resume site.
Still very much a work in progress.

So far i have:
 gotten a basic template started using bootstrap
 set up header and footer PHP pages to use as master pages
 set up a 404 and a 403 redirect
 used PHP to dynamically set the current page's title
 used PHP to dynamically highlight the current page's nav bar tab
 gotten place holders into each page.
 tweeked the css print settings (still more to do)
 
to do:
	~~add actual job descriptions and other text~~
	update fonts
	~~fix formatting~~
	~~check spelling, etc~~
	~~additional print css settings needed~~
	
	
	~~debate internally about layout....do i want to:~~
		~~remove "home" page, ~~
		~~get rid of contact page and leave on nav bar only, ~~
		~~move "contact" into "more..." tab,~~
		~~having skill page and key skills in resume seems redundant, remove one or only show on print view and show link to skills page online only?~~
		~~move quotes into a carasel on the front page?~~
