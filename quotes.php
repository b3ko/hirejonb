					"Jon has been invaluable to staff members that have questions, to me by making sure we learn from our past mistakes
					when designing new systems, and to all of our developers and support team in India who often rely heavily on 
					him to help, clarify, and come up with the best way of implementing something, whether it be a bug fix or a complex 
					report."

					"I can't count the number of times that a request or problem has surfaced and not only has Jon fixed that one issue, 
					but always follows through to consider if there are after-effects or related issues that need investigation too. Taking 
					this extra step (sometimes multiple steps) has been instrumental in making our users happy and appreciative of Jon's 
					hard work and dedication."

					"Jon Berkowitz has been a colleague of mine for the past 7 years; not only have we worked on several projects over the 
					years together, but Jon has always been my go-to guy for just about everything, whether it is directly related to his work 
					or not. Jon has an innate ability to proactively contemplate all scenarios that might affect a given project and not just 
					consider the "happy-path". This without doubt has saved many people many hours of future troubleshooting. Jon's dedication 
					and desire to help someone understand the "why" behind things also make him not just an invaluable resource but a teacher. 
					He will truly be missed."

					"Jon is a true believer in nothing is impossible. Some people, faced with an uphill challenge, might stop and move 
					onto something else. But Jon always digs in and no matter how difficult the business rule or technical details, he is 
					excited and genuinely invested in solving the issue."

					"Jon is my favorite team member, but not just on a personal level but because he never shies away from diving into a 
					big mess, learning by himself and fixing the issue - the right way. We need focus on quality and clean and simple solutions 
					and he is certainly one of the biggest and loudest advocate for that on our team."
